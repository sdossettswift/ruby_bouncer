Use ruby to build a program that will verify the ages of anyone using it and tell them what they are able to do at that age.

Deliverables

A link to a GitHub Repo with the bouncer.rb file

Requirements

The file should run without any errors or warnings,
The repository should have at least 2 commits.
Normal Mode

Write a method called check_age that is called every time the script is run.
When I run bouncer.rb I would like it to ask my age. It then tells me what I can do based on my age.
If I am younger than 18, I can do nothing.
If I am older than 18, I can vote.
If I am older than 18, I can smoke.
If I am older than 21, I can drink.
If I am older than 25, I can rent a car.
Difficult Mode

Modify the program to run in a loop constantly asking my age until the user asks to quit.
Epic Mode

Modify the program to first ask your country (US or UK).
If you are in the US, the rules stay the same.
If you are in the UK, the rules will change slightly.
If you are 18 you can drink
if you are 16 or 17 ask the user if their parents are there, if the answer is yes, then they can drink
Allow the user to change their country, age, or quit
